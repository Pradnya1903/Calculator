## Project Structure

## HTML (`index.html`)

This file contains the structure of the calculator, including the input display, buttons for digits and operations, and the logic to handle user input and display the results.

## CSS (`calculator.css`)

This file styles the calculator, providing the layout and aesthetic design. It includes a background color, button spacing, and styles for the display.

## JavaScript

The logic for calculator operations is written directly in the HTML file using inline event handlers. This JavaScript performs the following actions:
